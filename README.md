# ad_data_analysis
A Jupyter Notebook looking at ad data and modeling predictions on whether or not the customer clicked the ad. I used a decision tree algorithm followed by a Random Forest classifier, which achieved 97 and 98% precision on not clicking the ad and clicking the ad respectively.

There is also a PCA analysis on the default breast cancer dataset from the sklearn library. I then applied this procedure back to the ad data.

Enjoy!
